Hello everyone! I'm just practicing my skills in Expo/React native so don't care about this repo :)

Here I made an application where you can create something like posts, comments to them and you can edit anything of this.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT

- clone this repo to your pc;
- in the folder PostCreator run 'npm install' command.
